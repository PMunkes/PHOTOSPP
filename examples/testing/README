---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains a number of MC-TESTER based tests which can be 
performed to validate the currently installed version of PHOTOS and its 
interface against benchmark results encoded in root files.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

These tests use code located in "photos_test.c" and "photot_tauola_test.c".
These files contain hardcoded options for all of the tests and are not
designed to be manipulated by user. Appropriate options are set by makefiles.
For users willing to investigate all options, examples provided in 
"PHOTOS/examples" may represent better starting point.

To run, type "make" in directory testing. You can run a single test by 
"make" in the corresponding subdirectory. After the test is completed,
 MC-TESTER booklets can be found in the subdirectories of each test.
The number of generated events can be set in the "test.inc" file.

Note that examples:
- Htautau
- Ztautau

use "photos_tauola_test.c"; it requires that path to Tauola C++ Interface
is defined during configuration.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The list of modes and options used for generation is located in the
"test.inc" file. It is used by make. 

In some cases further changes to Makefile or SETUP.C files (located 
in  subdirectory of particular test) are needed.
Full list of such changes resides in:     README-comparison-options

    DEBUGGING
------------------
An additional directory is stored in our repository on kasztan.ifj.edu.pl,
for those with privileges it can be obtained with:

svn export file:///home/theory/svnroot/camtoph/PHOTOS/branches/debug

It contains number of tests; in particular unusual events stored in HepMC
data files. Thanks to James Monk, Andy Buckley, Sebastian Piec and others
for some of those files. In the past, we have used those events to localize
bugs in previous versions of Photos++ event interface
(or to understand necesity for new extensions of 
its event record algorithm). From now on we use those events 
for validation  of new changes. The files are large and that is why
we do no not include them in the distribution tar-ball.
